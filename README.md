Here I use the **Robust maximum likelihood method** to conduct a factor structure analysis.
Data from NOKUT's National student survey was used. Students reported on 10 items.
The analysis was guided by the **question**:	To what extent does the data from respondents of the 2018 cycle of the 
student survey reflect the self-reported learning outcome factor structure? 
Before modelling, a **multivariate outliers check** was done using Mahalanobis distance (Tabachnick et al., 2007) (the 205 
outliers identified were not removed, and **a sensitivity test was conducted**). **Multivariate descriptive statistics** (multivariate skewness and kurtosis)
were conducted using Mardia’s (1970) tests. Kline’s (2016) criteria of absolute skewness value of ≤ 3 and kurtosis value of ≤ 10 suggesting less severe non-normal distributions were used. 
**Pairwise scatter plots ** were used to investigate the linearity assumptions.
A **two-factor model** fit the data after modifications.
